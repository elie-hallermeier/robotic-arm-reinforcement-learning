# RL Robotic Arm – FetchReach (MuJoCo)

This project explores reinforcement learning for robotic manipulation
using MuJoCo, Gymnasium-Robotics, and Stable-Baselines3.

## What’s inside
- SAC training for FetchReachDense-v4
- Parallel environments for fast training
- Checkpointed training
- Replay scripts to visualize learning progression over time

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
